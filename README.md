# EasyUI.Messager.ProgressExt
A improvement on Messager component of EasyUI framework. New option to show endless Progressbar

When using Messager with progressbar of EasyUI framework to indicate the background work is on-going, it is hard and troublesome to tell user that loading is 100% completed. 

Hence, need the progressbar to be endless looping before .ajax done is triggerred.
